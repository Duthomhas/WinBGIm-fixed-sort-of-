This is an updated copy of the WinBGIm sources from http://winbgim.codecutter.org/.

The changes that have been made are minimal, encompasing the following:
  - const correctness repairs
  - removed bgi.cxx (and replaced it with ..\g++bgi.bat)
  - fixed an typo (where two function arguments had the same name)
  - deleted the extraneous copy of graphics.h
  - renamed and updated the Makefile to work with modern copies of MinGW, 
    including minor repairs
